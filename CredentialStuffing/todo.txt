Flow:
- User enter username/email and password
- Algorithm check credentials vs databases
    - No match
        - Perform number addition and capitalization variations and rerun Algorithm
            - No match
                - Report safe password
            - Match
                - Report time taken, search efficiency, # locations close hits found
    - Match found
        - Report time taken, search efficiency, # locations password found
    - Match found
        - Report time taken, search efficiency, # locations password found


Implementation:
- Prepare credential database with email/username password pairs.
    - Remove white spaces and lowercase for username/emails. CSV format for retrieval
- Search algorithm 
- Variation algorithm
- IP switching/randomize timing to simulate real security trigger and detection avoidance
- Continuous tracker of time taken, search efficiency, number of hits
